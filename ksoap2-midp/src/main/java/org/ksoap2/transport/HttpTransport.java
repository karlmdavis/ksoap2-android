/**
 * Methods to facilitate SOAP calls over HTTP using the J2ME generic connection
 * framework.
 * <p>
 * Instances of HttpTransport can be in one of two states: connected and not
 * connected. When an invocation on call is made the instance is in a connected
 * state until call returns or throws an IOException. in any case once control
 * is returned to the caller the instance is again in the not connected state.
 * HttpTransport is not thread safe and applications should ensure that only one
 * thread is inside the call method at any given time. It is designed in such a
 * way that applications can reuse a single instance for all soap calls to one,
 * or multiple, target endpoints.
 * <p>
 * 
 * The underlying HttpConnection is opened with the timeout flag set. In the
 * MIDP API this flag is only a hint to the underlying protocol handler to throw
 * an InterrruptIOException, however, there are no guarantees that it will be
 * handled. So rather than support a timeout mechanism internally the design is
 * such that applications can manage timeouts in an environment dependent way.
 * <p>
 * 
 * For example some environments may allow for a timeout parameter that can be
 * externally specified in perhaps a system property (which? I don't know. it's
 * in the api). Others like the emulator (ok, who cares) and the Motorola i85s
 * can use a simple and effective timeout mechanism that closes the connection
 * and associated streams in an asynchronous fashion. Calling the close( )
 * method inside of a separate thread can provide for this timeout handling by
 * releasing threads that maybe stuck inside of call( ) performing network io.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Here is some sample code to demonstrate how such a timeout mechanism may
 * look:<br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    private HttpTransport soap;
 *    ...
 *    TimerTask task =
 *    new TimerTask( ) { public void run( ) { soap.close( ); } };
 *   
 *    try {
 *    new Timer( ).schedule( task, TIMEOUT );
 *    soap.call( soapobject );  // invoke method
 *    task.cancel( );           // cancel the timeout
 *   
 *    } catch ( InterruptedIOException e ) {
 *    // handle timeout here...
 *   
 *    } catch ( IOException e ) {
 *    // some other io problem...
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <br>
 * The call( ) method will throw and InterruptedIOException if the instance is
 * no longer in the connected state before control is returned to the caller.
 * The call to soap.close( ) inside the TimerTask transitions the HttpConnection
 * into a not connected state.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note</b>: The InterruptedIOException will be caught by a thread waiting
 * on network io, however, it may not be immediate. It is assumed that the
 * protocol handler will gracefully handle the lifecycle of the outputstream and
 * therefore it is not closed inside the close method. IOW the waiting thread
 * will be interrupted after the outputstream has been flushed. If the waiting
 * thread is hung up waiting for input a call to close from a separate thread
 * the exception is observed right away and will return before the thread
 * calling close. <b>At least this is what has been observation on the i85s
 * handset.</b> On this device, if a call to outputstream.close( ) is made
 * while the outputstream is being flushed it seems to cause a deadlock, ie
 * outputstream will never return.
