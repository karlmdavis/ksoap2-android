== ksoap2-android - lightweight, efficient SOAP on Android

=== Introduction

The ksoap2-android project provides a lightweight and efficient SOAP client 
library for the Android platform.

It is a fork of the http://ksoap2.sourceforge.net/[kSOAP2 library] that is 
tested mostly on the Android platform, but should also work on other platforms 
using Java libraries.

Up to version 3.4.0, it is still using Java 1.3 so should work fine on JavaME, 
Blackberry and so on. Beyond that Java 1.5 is set as the language level.

ksoap2-android has been consistently enhanced and expanded with more features. 
It is actively maintained and we welcome bug fixes and contributions. Releases 
are done semi-regularly with community contributions in the form of enhancements
and more.
