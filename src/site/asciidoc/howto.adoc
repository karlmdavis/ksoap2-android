== Source and Javadoc == 

A very good source of documentation are the javadoc as well as the source both 
of which you can find in the project Maven repository. The source in the github
repository also contains numerous test that show how to do various things like 
creating requests and parsing results and so on.

If you use Maven javadoc and sources will all be hooked up in your IDE 
automatically and you can browse the source and documentation right during 
development. This should also work with Gradle.

To do the same with Ant or plain Android Development Toolkit (Eclipse plugin) 
based environment you will have to manually download the source and javadoc jar
files.
