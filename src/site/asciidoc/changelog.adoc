The project has been dormant for too long and as of today has been taken over by Manfred Moser http://www.simpligility.com. Thanks to Karl Davies for past project creation and maintenance

In the near term the following steps are planned:

We will create issues for all these tasks shortly and track progress with the issue tracker.

==== 2009-08-16, Development Status

My apologies for the long hiatus in updates to this project. I was actually quite surprised to discover today that others were making use of it. I just pushed out a new release (2.3) to resolve the issues folks were having making use of it.

If you'd like to help contribute to this project, please let me know. I'll try to put up a page with build instructions sometime in the near future.
