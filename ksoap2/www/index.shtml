<h1>kSOAP 2</h1>

<p>kSOAP is a SOAP web service client library for constrained Java environments such as
Applets or J2ME applications (CLDC / CDC / MIDP).</p>

<p>Please note that SOAP introduces some significant overhead for web services that
may be problematic for mobile devices. If you have full control over the client
and the server, a REST based architecture may be more adequate. Despite the name, 
REST is also more "object-oriented" than SOAP: The context of a REST request is always 
the object denoted by the URL, so the URL can be seen as a kind of "this"-pointer.</p>

<p>kSOAP 2 is a complete redesign, taking the lessons learned from kSOAP 1.x into account. 
Some important changes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Structure cleaned up</li>
<li>kSOAP2 has improved support for literal encoding</li>
<li>SOAP Serialization support is now optional and contained 
  in a separate package</li>
<li>Several separate classes have been integrated into the class
  class SoapSerializationEnvelope, providing 
  SOAP serialization support. SoapSerializationEnvelope extends the
  base class SoapEnvelope. </li>
<li>A dotNet flag can be used to switch the SoapSerializationEnvelope
  from standard behaviour to the namespace handling that seems to be
  default in .NET</li>
 </ul>

<p>Unfortunately, the improvements will require some additional effort when porting
applications from kSOAP 1 to kSOAP 2. </p>

<p>kSOAP 1 is deprecated and archived at 
<a href="http://ksoap.objectweb.org/">ksoap.objectweb.org</a> (thanks to the objectweb.org team for 
keeping the kSOAP 1 pages after the merger with enhydra.org).

<p><b>Please find more information (mailing lists, releases) at the kObjects Sourceforge pages:</b> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ksoap2/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ksoap2/</a>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The kSOAP JavaDoc and some examples are contained in the source distribution.</p>

<p>There are some articles about available on the net (unfortunately covering kSOAP 1 only):</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/08/19/ksoap.html">Low Bandwidth SOAP (Jeff McHugh, xml.com)</a></li>
   <li><a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/edu/wi-dw-wiwsvs-i.html">Deliver Web services to mobile apps (Naveen Balani, IBM developerworks tutorial, registration required)</a></li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Help Wanted</h2>

<p>If you have created an open source client for a web service that is open to anyone, please let us know,
so we can reference it here or include it in the kSOAP examples!</p>
