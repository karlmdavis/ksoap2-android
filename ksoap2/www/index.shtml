<p>2006-03-08 -- Updates fixing some bugs and working towards a releasable version. </p>


<p>2006-02-05 -- The project is undergoing work to enhance testing
increase stability and keep pushing forward development to remove bugs
and apply new features</p>





<h2>Background</h2>




<p>kSOAP is a SOAP web service client library for constrained Java
environments such as Applets or J2ME applications (CLDC / CDC / MIDP).</p>





<p>Please note that SOAP introduces some significant overhead for web
services that may be problematic for mobile devices. If you have full
control over the client and the server, a REST based architecture may
be more adequate.</p>





<p>kSOAP 2 is a complete redesign, taking the lessons learned from kSOAP 1.x into account. Some important changes are:</p>





<ul>




	<li>Structure cleaned up</li>




	<li>kSOAP2 has improved support for literal encoding</li>




	<li>SOAP Serialization support is now optional and contained in a separate package</li>




	<li>Several separate classes have been integrated into the class
SoapSerializationEnvelope, providing SOAP serialization support.
SoapSerializationEnvelope extends the base class SoapEnvelope. </li>




	<li>A dotNet flag can be used to switch the SoapSerializationEnvelope
from standard behaviour to the namespace handling that seems to be
default in .NET</li>




</ul>





<p>Unfortunately, the improvements will require some additional effort when porting applications from kSOAP 1 to kSOAP 2. </p>





<p>kSOAP 1 is deprecated and archived at <a href="http://ksoap.objectweb.org/">ksoap.objectweb.org</a> (thanks to the objectweb.org team for keeping the kSOAP 1 pages after the merger with enhydra.org).

<p><b>Please find more information (mailing lists, releases) at the kSoap2 Sourceforge pages:</b> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ksoap2/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ksoap2/</a></p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>





<p>The kSOAP JavaDoc and some examples are contained in the source distribution.</p>





<p>An online version of the kSOAP2 API can be found online <a href="doc/api">here</a>.</p>

<p>An early documentation project has be started and is located at this <a href="http://ksoap2.seigel.info">wiki site</a>.</p>





<p>There are some articles about available on the net (unfortunately covering kSOAP 1 only):</p>





<ul>




   <li><a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/08/19/ksoap.html">Low Bandwidth SOAP (Jeff McHugh, xml.com)</a></li>




   <li><a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/wireless/edu/wi-dw-wiwsvs-i.html">Deliver Web services to mobile apps (Naveen Balani, IBM developerworks tutorial, registration required)</a></li>




</ul>




 
<h2>Help Wanted</h2>





<p>If you have created an open source client for a web service that is
open to anyone, please let us know, so we can reference it here or
include it in the kSOAP examples!</p>
